# Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design

## STEP 1: Choosing a Visualization

The visualization below is sourced from the [Alabama Department of Labor website](https://www2.labor.alabama.gov/Laus/InitialClaimsTab.aspx). I initially chose this visualization for my critique and redesign because of the value of the information. Watching the trends of unemployment insurance claims over time with the knowledge of the pandemic is an interesting enough concept, and the visualization used by Alabama’s Department of Labor (still live as of September 20th, 2022) wasn’t conveying the information as best as it could. I found it even more interesting given the choropleth map on the same page that does an amazing job of showing the change in claims across counties over time.

  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1663722500042');                    
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    
  if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 800 ) { vizElement.style.width='1000px';vizElement.style.height='1050px';} else if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 500 ) { vizElement.style.width='1000px';vizElement.style.height='1050px';} else { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height='950px';}                     
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    
  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                
</script>

## STEP 2: Critique the Visualization

Using a Google form supplied by Professor Goranson, I critiqued the visualization using three questions.

#### *1. Describe your overall observations about the data visualization here.  What stood out to you?  What did you find worked really well?  What didn't?  What, if anything, would you do differently?*

My first observation is that there are too many things going on in this spiral-like bubble chart. The title fades into the background somewhat (at least against all of the colors), but because the visualization is so confusing, I sought it out next. With that context, the size and labeling of some dots became more clear. I think the interactive element of the visualization works well. Looking at the left hand side, you are able to choose which county you want to observe and then watch as the visualization changes to match that section of data. The chart also changes for each county, but shows the chronological list of every unemployment insurance claim since March 14th, 2020. 

What doesn’t work is the layout of the actual visualization. Similar to a pie chart or an unordered bar chart, the differences in size between the circles is difficult to differentiate even with some of them labeled. Sure, you can hover over each and find out the value and associated date, but there is no clear pattern shown other than there is a collection of 5-6 dates per county that all saw historical increases in unemployment claims. The lack of chronological order in the visualization itself makes it difficult for the pattern to be observable, the pattern that clearly should state how unemployment insurance claims rose rapidly (by varying degrees) in counties of Alabama around the beginning of the pandemic. 

If I could change anything, I would edit this visualization to be a line graph that populates for any given selected county to show the rise and fall of unemployment claims over time. I would also limit the use of color as the color choices do not signify anything in particular and distract from the overall message. 

#### *2. Who is the primary audience for this tool?  Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience?  Why or why not?*

The primary audience for this interactive visualization would be anyone curious about the variation by Alabama county in unemployment insurance claims over time. This could be someone studying labor politics or comparing economic based pandemic responses between regions, or even someone trying to focus on the differences in Alabama counties themselves (given some additional demographic information found elsewhere of course). Ultimately, I think this visualization CAN be effective for that audience, but only because that audience seems likely to pour over the data in order to observe patterns regardless of the state of the visualization. The hyperspecificity of the data broken down by county does not seem like it’d be a visualization for the general population. However, these patterns still take extra time to view given the lack of chronological focus in the visualization despite the title implying it is meant to be viewed chronologically. This could be clarified either by transitioning the visualization into a line graph for each county for those interested in the by county breakdown OR consolidating the numbers to show historic weeks of unemployment insurance claims for the entire state. 

#### *3. Final thoughts: how successful what this method at evaluating the data visualization you selected? Are there measures you feel are missing or not being captured here?  What would you change?  Provide 1-2 recommendations (color, type of visualization, layout, etc.)*

I enjoyed the Effectiveness Profile method for critiquing because I think it best touches as many areas as possible for critique while allowing the critiquer to provide quick responses. By giving me a range of answers (the 1-10 scale), I was able to evaluate the visualization quickly without thinking too in-depth about how to best word my answers. It was solely based on what I felt in the moment after reading the question, which I feel would be my most honest answer. I also enjoyed the spectrum of categories in that it allows a visualization to be successful in some areas while lacking in others rather than leaving me to write a wall of text essentially saying how lack-luster a visualization might be. In this case, the visualization isn’t misleading or lying, the data is just organized poorly and takes too much time for a casual reader to get sucked into the story. Other visualizations might be aesthetically and technically sound, and still mislead audiences. This profile method helped me zero in on issues quickly, and I appreciated that.

Specific to my visualization, I think its usefulness is ultimately what could use the most help. The data here is interesting, but its specificity is taking away from the data itself. On the same page is a choropleth map that does a great cross-county comparison over time by having the user choose a week in order to see the map adjust. That visualization handles the cross-county comparison fine. This visualization, in my opinion, would be better focused if it zoomed out to view the overall state’s trend over time, which matches the title much better. To accomplish this, I would consolidate the data to be the total amount of unemployment insurance claims per week in the state of Alabama. I would then use that data to form a line graph showing the rise and fall in claims over time. This would allow the user to instantly understand where the peak of unemployment insurance claims exists in the past two and a half years and pinpoint it to the current events of that time (ie the beginning of the pandemic, specifically prior to any vaccine). Additionally, I would also shorten the length of time the data is presented at, such as only showing the first 90 days of the pandemic response or maybe going as far as to when the first COVID-19 vaccines were administered. That recommendation would be specific to the audience, though. 

## STEP 3: Sketches

For both sketches, I chose to consolidate the date into total counts of unemployment insurance claims for the state of Alabama between March 14th (when the dataset began) to the end of that calendar year. This simplified the overall dataset and made it relevant to what most people would consider the peak times of the pandemic given vaccines were rolled out toward the end of 2020, thus also marking the point at which pandemic specific COVID-19 benefits ended.

**Sketch One:** For my first sketch, I chose a line graph showcasing the overall trend of data between March 14th and the end of the calendar year. I think this redesign best focuses on what I believe the original visualization was trying to showcase, which is the historic trends over a period of time (as seen visually by the large spike in data toward the beginning of the timeline). A line graph is a common choice for this sort of data representation, and I believe making it appear clean and simple gets that intended message across.

**Sketch Two:** For my second sketch, I chose to focus on the historic aspect of the trends with a few bars representing the top six days of unemployment insurance claims. Because these dates happen to be in chronological order, I chose to maintain that order instead of prioritizing the order of the bars. With dates on the y-axis, it seems more likely to me that readers would be confused by those dates being out of order if the bars themselves were put in order. To help make the bar with the highest total count stand out, I chose to highlight it with color, turning it into a main feature while the other data become ground features.

## STEP 4: Peer Critique Notes

I recruited someone both within my sphere of classmates at CMU (though not someone in our class) and a friend from before attending CMU to get two perspectives (hopefully one STEM oriented and one none-STEM oriented). I made a google form to make it easiest on them given tight schedules. 

**Student, mid 20’s:** This respondent recognized that the data shown to them in both sketches had to do with unemployment insurance claims related to the pandemic, specifically complimenting the specificity of the titles. Neither sketch was confusing or surprising to this respondent, but they did ask for more clarity in the axis labels as well as the labeling of the dates along the x-axis in the line graph with the addition of adding more dates (potentially) to the bars. Ultimately, this respondent preferred the line graph.

**Young Professional, mid 20s:** This respondent recognized the trend in data first (given the shark incline on the line graph). They elaborated on the trend, pulling dates from the title, and made a point to say that the x-axis on the line graph could be better labeled by dates. It isn’t clear from the sketch, but each tick-mark is one week, so they suggested labeling the months and adding a note to the x-axis label to make that clear. For the bars, they recommended flipping the orientation of the graph entirely so chronological time could be on the x-axis and the values could be on the y-axis. This solved my problem of not knowing when to put dates in order versus putting the bars in order of hierarchy. However, this orientation of the graph might only be helpful for using fewer dates. Adding more dates makes a line graph the better visualization choice. Ultimately, this respondent preferred the line graph.

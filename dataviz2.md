# Assignment #2: Visualizing Government Debt

## Data Visualization #1
This visualization was screated by the OECD page.

## Data Visualization #2
This visualization was created in flourish.studio. It is a grid of line charts showing a location's progression in their debt-to-GDP ratio over time (from 1995 to 2021). Some locations do not have for this entire length of time.

## Data Visualization #3
This visualization was created in flourish.studio. It is an animated scatterplot to show the dynamic change in a location's debt-to-GDP ratio over time (again, from 1995 to 2021).

## Discussion of Methods
Comparing the three data visualization types, I have to say I prefer my final rendition of the visualization. The first visualization is limited by the fact that it best displays over the course of one single year. You could have multiple bar charts, of course, but attempting to compare change over time with a list of countries can get difficult if those bars are not visually next to each other like we have discussed with hierarchy rules. The grid of line charts helps by expanding each change per country out into an individual graph, but having that many graphs at once makes it difficult to distinguish what is important. This could be fixed by changing the colors for one specific graph. However, the animated scatterplot I chose compiles that information into one singular chart with data points that shift around depending on the year. The only issue I have with it is that I wasn't able to figure out how to prioritize one section of data (such as the average debt-to-GDP ratio or maybe the USA's ratio), so each point isn't necessarily distinguishable from each other without interacting with the chart. Quick chart readers might also not wait for the entire sequence of time to pass, which makes the grid of line charts the better option to get all the information at once. This would ultimately depend on the need for the data. If only one year is needed, the bar chart supplied by the OECD page works just fine. If that change over time is necessary, I would prefer my animated scatterplot as a chart reader, but I would need to know more about the potential audience to gauge what would work best for them.

# About Me
Hi everyone! My name is Rachel Frederiksen and I use she/her pronouns. I'm a second-year student in Heinz' Masters of Science in Public Policy and Management Flagship program (MSPPM). My areas of policy interest are in rural and agricultural development, but I am also interested in equity projects regarding organized labor, tenant rights, and social services. I went to the University of Minnesota Duluth for undergrad where I majored in Political Science and Communication, and also minored in Philosophy. I did a lot of campaign work throughout undergrad in the form of campus organizing as well as formally within a local political party unit. I spent this past summer working in digital production for a digital political strategy firm called Trilogy Interactive where I did quite a bit of HTML/Markdown coding as well as some database management, social media management, and strategy building sessions. 

I'm originally from a rural community in Northeastern Wisconsin, but I also grew up on my grandparents' cattle ranch turned alfalfa farm in the Upper Peninsula (UP) of Michigan. Personally, I really enjoy making playlists for my commute to and from campus, spending time with my friends at Heinz, and watching college hockey.

# What I hope to learn
As someone who has worked alongside the political sphere for a few years, one of the most frustrating things to witness is misleading graphics via their data visualization. Sometimes maliciously misleading, but sometimes accidentally misleading. Information, especially complex information potentially solving large policy problems, is only powerful if it can be conveyed properly to the masses. I hope to learn techniques for simplifying complex policy questions into something that becomes actually useful for the people that need that information. Once I graduate this spring, I am intending to move back to the Midwest and prioritize working at the intersection of policy analysis and data visualization in rural or agricultural development.

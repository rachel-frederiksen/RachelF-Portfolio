## Storyboard Outline

### Setup

First, I will introduce the topic with the basic definitions of labor unions and right-to-work legislation. As a final project, this will allow the story to be accessible to most people regardless of prior understanding. For my presentation, these definitions will more than likely not be included. This introduction will then pivot to the first data visualization (image 1).

**Image 1:** 
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/11373594"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

This visualization shows the cumulative count of states that have adopted RTW legislation over time (1944 to 2017). Clearly there is an uphill trend in RTW legislation across the U.S. After this visualization, I will use isolation as a persuasive tactic to highlight that over half of states in the U.S. now have RTW legislation, effectively preventing strong unions from forming in those states. This transitions into my second visualization (image 2) as raw numbers can struggle to convey how much area is covered by this legislation.

As a product of RTW legislation implementation, union membership has decreased over time. I will then transition to my third visualization (image 3) which shows the decrease in union membership over time (1986 to 2015).

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/11373936"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

After this visualization, I will highlight a key point through isolation again that union membership rates have essentially cut in half in this length of time (~20% to 11%). This concludes the setup portion of the story. Decreased unionization rates are not necessarily a bad thing. At this point, I am just conveying that RTW legislation has led to the decrease in union membership across the U.S. 

### Conflict

I will then transition into the conflict portion of the story, highlighting how nonunionized workers (on average) earn less than their unionized counterparts. If the original proponents for RTW legislation had any interest in paying their workers less in the long run, this may be a problematic connection to discover. Even if the intent wasn't malicious, lower union membership rates connects to more workers being paid less. I will then use my fourth visualization (image 4) to show that difference much more visually.

Image 4: 
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/11374068"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

After this visualization, I may introduce some information regarding the tensions in the U.S. regarding poor working conditions. I believe the visualization is enough conflict to move into the call to action, but user feedback will ultimately dictate this choice. This will mark the end of the conflict section.

### Resolution

A systemic problem can seem too daunting to solve, so I want to prioritize showing how things can and have already changed. Union approval ratings are at an all time high, showing that people are no longer as turned off by

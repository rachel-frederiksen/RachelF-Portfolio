## Storyboard Outline

### Setup

First, I will introduce the topic with the basic definitions of labor unions and right-to-work (RTW) legislation. 

Labor unions are groups of workers who organize together in support of their own interests, usually as a precautionary or protective measure against their employers. For labor unions to be successful in organizing (otherwise known as collective bargaining), they charge dues from workers. Without RTW legislation, collective bargaining benefits all workers regardless of membership status, so all workers have to pay dues. 

RTW legislation is framed to be in support of workers. By providing people the "right to work", this legislation simplifies union dues to paying to go to work. It works by stopping unions from collecting dues from anyone who does not want to pay them. This supports workers that weren't members of their unions who didn't want to pay dues, but it also targets new workers into being apprehensive of joining their unions in the first place. Nobody wants to pay to go to work. On a simplified level, that does seem ludacris.

I will use the image above to introduce the story with the passing of the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947. This was federal legislation that addressed the power of labor unions in the aftermath of a 113-day automotive worker strike after WW2. Labor unions were no longer allowed to gather dues from anyone who didn't wish to pay them.

This visualization shows the cumulative count of states that have adopted RTW legislation over time (1944 to 2017). Clearly there is an uphill trend in RTW legislation across the U.S. Considering the context of why the Taft-Hartley Act was enacted and the speed in which states were enacting RTW legislation, it begs the question if this was about supporting workers or about destabilizing powerful unions who were stopping employers from taking advantage of their employees.

After this visualization, I will use isolation as a persuasive tactic using the image below to highlight that over half of states in the U.S. now have RTW legislation, effectively preventing strong unions from forming in those states.

This transitions into my second visualization as raw numbers can struggle to convey how much area is covered by this legislation. Using a map brings focus to what states exactly have this legislation. Someone with further electoral knowledge of this map may then gather that the states with this legislation are often states with predominately conservative state governments. Further research could be done in this area to compare metrics RTW and non-RTW states, but that is beyond the scope of this presentation.

As a product of RTW legislation implementation, union membership has decreased over time. I will then transition to my third visualization which shows the decrease in union membership over time (1986 to 2015). 

**Viz 3** 
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/11373936"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

After this visualization, I will highlight a key point through isolation again that union membership rates have essentially cut in half in this length of time (~20% to 11%) using the image below.

This concludes the setup portion of the story. Decreased unionization rates are not necessarily a bad thing. At this point, I am just conveying that RTW legislation has led to the decrease in union membership across the U.S. 

### Conflict

I will then transition into the conflict portion of the story, highlighting how nonunionized workers (on average) earn less than their unionized counterparts. If the original proponents for RTW legislation had any interest in paying their workers less in the long run, this may be a problematic connection to discover. Even if the intent wasn't malicious, lower union membership rates connects to more workers being paid less. Again, given the context of the 113-day strike of automotive workers, the connotations are not really positive. I will then use my fourth visualization to show that difference much more visually.

**Viz 4** 
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/11374068"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

After this visualization, I may introduce some information regarding the tensions in the U.S. regarding poor working conditions. I believe the visualization is enough conflict to move into the call to action, but user feedback will ultimately dictate this choice. This will mark the end of the conflict section.

### Resolution

A systemic problem can seem too daunting to solve, so I want to prioritize showing how things can and have already changed. Union approval ratings are at an all time high, showing that people are no longer as turned off by the thought of unions. Given the past ~80 years of anti-union sentiment in legislation, seeing approval ratings increase is an incredible win for organizers.

How has an increased approval rating in unions really impacted the current labor market, though? Plenty of Americans approve of things without those topics ending up as political legislation or actual movements that create change. This is where the story of Starbucks comes in. 

On December 9th, 2021, in Buffalo, New York, the very first Starbucks location unionized [Source](https://www.vox.com/recode/22825850/starbucks-union-first-organizing-vote-nlrb). I will be using this date as well as a quote from the article to convey the beginning of a movement. The quote is as follows: [“Sometimes strikes and union organizing victories can be very contagious,” said Johnnie Kallas, a PhD candidate at Cornell’s Industrial and Labor Relations school]

Less than a year ago, the first Starbucks location unionized. Since then, over 200 stores have successfully won their union elections. That contagious nature has officially taken hold.

**Viz 6**
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/11373393"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

Starbucks has officially opened the door for workers across the U.S. to get involved, to quit accepting the poor working conditions they are in, and to organize despite the previously successful pushback RTW legislation had on states. RTW legislation doesn't prevent you from unionizing, it just makes it harder. These workers aren't giving up. Not just Starbucks employees either. Anywhere from Amazon to REI to Chipotle, workers are standing up and fighting back. So much so that in the past year alone (as of August 30th, 2022), unions have won more elections than they have in the past twenty years.

**Call to Action**

If you're concerned about the environment of your workplace, organizing might just be a viable option for you and your coworkers. Accepting lower wages, minimal benefits, or bad working conditions no longer needs to be the norm. Consider a union today.

## User Protocol Feedback

**Target Audience:** My target audience are those on the fence about unionizing, especially in the wave of unionization efforts across the U.S. currently. 

**Identifying Approach:** Similar to my previous conducted interviews, I am approaching gathering feedback in the same way. I want some respondents to have some knowledge of unionization efforts as well as data visualization in general, but I also want some respondents to have a minimal understanding of both. My respondents are a mixture of current graduate students and young professionals, all of which are between the ages of 23 and 28.

**Interview Script:**
1. Who do you believe is the target audience?
2. For each viz (1-6), describe what you're being told and if there are any areas of confusion.
3. Was any information presented to you new? If you learned something, what was it?
4. If you could fix one thing throughout the presentation, what would it be?

**Feedback:**

*Young Professional, 23*: The first respondant understood who the target audience was fairly early on in the presentation. Regarding the two line graphs and one area graph, they made a point to comment that the pop-up bars are not as clearly defined as they could be. While an axis label may list something as a %, the pop-up box does not, and it drew their eye away from the information and back toward the labels instead. This respondant really enjoyed the Starbucks visualization as well as the associated imagery. They also offered some advice for Shorthand's Reveal template (the black and white transition filter specificaly), that I will be checking out. This respondant was both shocked and happy to see the sheer volume of organizing in 2022 and praised my resolution for being adequately positive after such a potentially disheartening setup. Their one fix was to clarify the pop-up labels on the previously mentioned graphs as the ability to be interactive with them feels lost when the pop-ups aren't clear. 

Most Helpful Quote: "I just keep looking at the axis labels instead of the information on the visualization itself, which is taking away from the overall power of the visualization."

*Heinz Student, 26*: This respondent pointed out that the target audience might include those with a negative attitude toward unions. While this was not my intended audience per se, I obviously would be very happy to convince anyone with a negative opinion to change their mind. This respondent felt as if the visualizations conveyed the information adequately, but did point out the order of some highlight statistics and suggested I try moving them around (displaying some key points before and after visualizations) to see if that changes the flow of the presentation at all. They also pointed out a typo in my fifth visualization’s title. Not as familiar with union organizing as the previous respondent, this respondent was interested in how the Taft-Hartley Act came to be, and recommended that I make a statistics-like isolation section regarding the 113-day automotive strike. They did not have any one thing they thought should be majorly fixed (beyond the typo). They just told me to play around with the order of things to see if that changes the flow at all. 

Most Helpful Quote: "Some of the key points, like the statistic where union membership rates have been cut in half, might do better after the visualization but some of the other statistics might do better before. Just change things around to see if it really changes your message."

*Union Member, 28*: As a current union member, this respondent was quick to pick up on the target audience as well (like the first respondent). They were extremely happy to see the discussion about RTW legislation as the lead-in since these laws are still being proposed in other states. They also liked the simplicity of my conflict section as they feel most American workers are going to zero-in on the wage discrepancy first when it comes to their workplaces. Their main critique of the visualizations was also the pop-up labels for the visualizations that have them. They also made a point to say that it was easy to follow along most of my sections of text, but that my platform of choice (ie using my Github page) wasn’t as clear as I linked images and sources that took you away from the page. None of the information was new to them as they talked about following the news about Starbucks and other new unionizing places in the past year. Their one fix was between the pop-up labels and the platform. (I did explain we were using shorthand for our final presentations after the interview).

Most Helpful Quote: "Your conflict section highlights what is the problem, that there is this idea of paying to work and losing out on your wage when in actuality you're getting paid more with better benefits and better protection when in a union. People just don't get that in the short-term, though, but I think your chart here highlights it great."

**Patterns and Potential Changes**

I am definitely going to change the pop-up labels after this user feedback. While I did not get some feedback until after the in-class critique, classmates also pointed out how the labeling is taking away from the vizualization by not being as clear as it could be. I was also worried about some lacking context in my conflict section, but none of my respondents seemed bothered by it and that also wasn't a huge issue in the in-class critique. A classmate went as far as saying that since the first 2/3 of the visualizations are essentially so negative, adding more negative context there might just overload the user. Another classmate did say that I could flesh out some more text in that spot, but that they agreed to not add another visualization in that spot. 

I was happy to see that my audience was clear to my respondents through the presentation itself. I know I will need to pick a really strong title to assist in that, and I am considering asking the three of them again for a mini-interview about some options that I have just for consistency sake since they viewed the presentation without any formal title. I think this shows that my topic has a clear story, both chronologically by starting at the enaction of the Taft-Hartley Act in the 40s and concluding in unionization efforts today, but also that it all seems to fit together. Hopefully my in-class presentation will also convey that same story, albiet shorter.

*Project Changes:* the pop-up labels, highlighting the 113-day strike, adjusting the order of the statistics and their corresponding visualizations, and tying in more text-context in the conflict section rather than an additional visualization.

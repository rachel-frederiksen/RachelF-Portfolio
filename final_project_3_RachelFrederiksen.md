### Implemented Changes

Referencing the potential changes I compiled after my interviews, I ultimately chose to take some of the feedback and go further with some of my own changes. My first edits had to do with my visualizations. First, I edited the pop-up labels for all of the charts I created. This was an easy fix in flourish. Second, I added additional context in the set-up regarding the 113-day strike in shorthand to provide a more chronological feel to the story. As I wanted to prioritize that passing through time experience, I think this addition aides in that. I addressed the concern about order in terms of the visualizations by removing the approval rating visualization from my shorthand altogether (though it remains on my part two). I realized that this visualization was not really transforming the data or original visualization that it came from and it also wasn’t adding to my story. While public approval is important, it just did not fit in with the resolution I created using Starbucks as a case study. Third, while minor, I did follow advice from my graded feedback on part 2 to make the colors more cohesive with the same red used throughout MINUS the use of Starbucks green in the applicable visualization for branding purposes.

My next edits had to do with the in-text context provided throughout the story. I first adjusted some of my sources. Regarding the 113-day strike, I drew information from [here](https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/today-in-labor-history-113-day-strike-against-gm-in-194/) instead of my original source [here](https://www.influencewatch.org/legislation/labor-management-relations-act-of-1947-taft-hartley-act/) due to the tone of the latter source. As this is a pro-union story, I do not want to use information that promotes anti-union rhetoric. I already reframed misinformation from anti-union data sources, so I wanted to reduce how much I was linking back to anti-union rhetoric even if I was directly combating it. I also included a working paper regarding RTW’s impact on unionization membership rates, linked [here](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w30098/w30098.pdf) as it provides some interesting statistical analysis that supports my story. I am also exploring this subject in another course and wanted to include my outside research for a different assignment. I finally added in some COVID-19 labor context, linked [here](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/20/global-shortage-of-workers-whats-going-on-experts-explain.html). A critique I got was the lack of supporting conflict context, and I wanted to continue that chronological flow of the story by adding in what sparked this new focus on unionization: poor working conditions exposed by COVID-19. 

Beyond that, I decided to get rid of a few images from my part 2 and, of course, had to include many others to flesh out the creative direction of the story. 

### Overall Reflection

It is interesting to see how this project has evolved from part 1 through part 3. Originally, I wanted to provide a story that framed this evolution of labor politics as a partisan issue. While it definitely is given how conservatives are traditionally anti-union and especially were in the 40s, I found myself wanting to prioritize the hardships we as workers faced in the aftermath of March 2020 as well as the countless organizers fighting for better working conditions. That experience and that work is what is most important and most inspiring, not spite directed back at history. 

My envisioned audience did not really change throughout this project, which I find interesting. Ultimately, those who dare vehemently against unionization might not hear this presentation well, but those who lack the deeper knowledge or those who are on the fence might. I really find my call to action the most inspiring because organizing in a workplace feels like an incredibly tangible act to take, especially with how many people are successful in places of employment that feel impossible to unionize (Amazon, REI, Starbucks, etc). 

Something I really would like to flesh out at a later date would be some of the deeper issues with the Taft-Hartley Act such as its anti-communist footnotes as well as the transformation the U.S. has seen under Red Scare tactics. As this presentation is fairly concise in its story, that might be a secondary story to make, but it would still be really interesting to unpack further.
